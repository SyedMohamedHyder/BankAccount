# BankAccount
In this repository I am going to create a class which will implement the functionality of a BankAccount

### Account This class will have the following public interface:
```      
	* initializer(account_number, first_name, last_name, timezone=utc, balance=0)     
	* first_name property (read/write)
	* last_name property (read/write) 
	* balance property (read-only)
	* interest_rate (class level property)
	* deposit, withdraw, pay_interest (methods)
	* confirmation code parser

```
